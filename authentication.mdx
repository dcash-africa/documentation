## Authentication Overview

The DCash API uses a two-level authentication system to ensure secure access:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Merchant Authentication">
    API requests are authenticated using your merchant API key via the `x-api-key` header
  </Step>
  <Step title="User Authentication">
    For user-specific operations, a user token is required via the `Authorization` header with the format `Bearer {token}`
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How It Works

Tokens are obtained through the OAuth authorization flow. Here's the complete process:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initiate OAuth Flow">
    Your application redirects the user to the DCash authorization endpoint
  </Step>
  <Step title="User Authenticates">
    User logs in with their DCash credentials and approves access permissions
  </Step>
  <Step title="Receive Token">
    Upon successful authentication, DCash sends an authorization token to your pre-registered webhook endpoint
  </Step>
  <Step title="User Redirected">
    The user is redirected back to your specified redirect URL
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Authorization Headers

### Merchant API Key

Include your merchant API key in all requests:

```bash
x-api-key: YOUR_MERCHANT_API_KEY
```

### User Token

For user-specific operations, include the user's authorization token:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer {user_token}
```

## Token Management

<Warning>
  Tokens are sensitive credentials. Follow these best practices:
</Warning>

- **Store securely**: Use appropriate encryption when storing tokens
- **Use HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS for redirect URLs
- **Validate redirects**: Ensure redirect URLs match your expected domain
- **Handle revocation**: Users can revoke tokens through the DCash app or website
- **Re-authenticate**: If a token becomes invalid, repeat the authorization flow

## Getting Started

To implement authentication in your application:

1. Register your application to receive your merchant API key
2. Configure your webhook URL in your merchant account settings
3. Implement the OAuth flow using the [Authentication endpoint](/api-reference/user-management/oauth-login)
